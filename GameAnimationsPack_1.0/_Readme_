--Things to Do--

- Make sure existing player scores are updated with better score based on matching USER ID

- Purge total scores that are too low. Need to limit the number of scores to show. Maybe 10 - 20 players?

- Added additional table to scoreboard for current race results. Although, display of results is currently not working, yet.

- Any possible way for people who lost or have timed out an easier way back to Start Line?

- Script each asset so that when user places them on ground, errors are not thrown.
